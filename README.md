# DEFO - LS

This is a fork of the original code containing the Link Guided Local Search algorithm described in ["Gay, Steven, Renaud Hartert, and Stefano Vissicchio. *Expect the unexpected: Sub-second optimization for segment routing.* IEEE INFOCOM 2017-IEEE Conference on Computer Communications. IEEE, 2017."](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8056971).
